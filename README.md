# About me

### Hello everyone! I'm happy to share some of my interests and passions with you. This is a new adventure for me and I'm looking forward to learning new stuff along the way. See you around 😁

- I'm currently working on a personal project, an indie game! 🎮
- I'm learning how to bring it to life with the game engine Godot 💾
I'm also passionate about many types of art:
- I love drawing ✏
- I like making short animations 🏃
- I enjoy 3D modelling 🏛
- I sometimes play around with music 🎶
